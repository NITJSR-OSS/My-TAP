# My TAP - Hacktoberfest 2020


Hi! Welcome to My TAP : A Portal to Share Interview experiences  **Android Application** challenge for [Hactoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). A project focused on people getting started with Android development with Java.


Everyone is encouraged to participate, regardless of your skill level (If you don't have the required skills, use this project as a motivation to learn those!). This is a practice project and should be considered a playground.
